# azure_data_engineering

My Azure data engineering project is focused on enhancing my proficiency with Azure technologies.

Topics covered: 

Azure Data Factory
Data Integration & Transformation

Integrate varied data sources/formats into Azure Data Lake Gen2 using ADF.
Implement Mapping Data Flows for transformations like Filter, Split, Join, Aggregate, and more.
Create generic parameter-driven pipelines using parameters, variables, and Azure KeyVault.
Pipeline Development

Use control flow activities (e.g., Get Metadata, ForEach, If Conditions).
Handle data quality with Assert transformations and error handling.
Develop pipelines for SCD types, fact tables, and universal components like Flowlets.
Scheduling & Orchestration

Schedule pipelines with triggers (Event, Schedule, Tumbling Window).
Use dependencies to chain pipelines and orchestrate ETL/ELT processes.
Monitoring & Debugging

Monitor pipelines using Azure Data Factory Monitor and Azure Monitor metrics.
Debug pipelines and resolve issues efficiently.
Integration with Azure Databricks
